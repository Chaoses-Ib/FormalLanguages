1. The algorithm forms in mind
2. The algorithm is written down in some formal language
3. Some executor executes the formal language

Since we are in a physical world, the executor must have a physical form. Humans can be used, but too slow and unreliable. So we made machines to do the job.

However, machines can only read a fixed formal language. And manipulating the physical world is much harder than the information world, so to support multiple formal languages (for various reasons) in an efficient way, programs in some other formal languages are translated to the supported formal language before execution.

However, one machine can only execute one program at a time. This looks not exactly a problem, but humans are pretty limited at the individual level and have to work together, requiring the machine to execute different programs together. A program is then made to manage all other programs.

The executor is usually called [processor](Processors/README.md), or central processing unit (CPU). Formal languages usually translated to machine language are usually called (high-level) [programming languages](#programming-languages), and the translators are usually called [compilers](Compilers/README.md). The managing program is usually called operating system ([Linux](https://github.com/Chaoses-Ib/Linux), [Windows](https://github.com/Chaoses-Ib/Windows)).

## Programming languages
A programming language is any set of rules that converts strings, or graphical program elements in the case of visual programming languages, to various kinds of machine code output.[^wiki]
