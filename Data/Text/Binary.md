> There are 94 Unicode characters which can be represented as one byte according to the JSON spec (if your JSON is transmitted as UTF-8). With that in mind, I think the best you can do space-wise is base85 which represents four bytes as five characters. However, this is only a 7% improvement over base64, it's more expensive to compute, and implementations are less common than for base64 so it's probably not a win.

### yEnc
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YEnc)

Only `NUL`, `LF`, `CR`, and `=` are escaped.

> YEnc is unsuitable when the text will be transfered as UTF-8.

  ```ts
  function base64ToBytes(base64) {
    const binString = atob(base64);
    return Uint8Array.from(binString, (m) => m.codePointAt(0));
  }

  function bytesToBase64(bytes: Uint8Array) {
    const binString = Array.from(bytes, (byte) =>
      String.fromCodePoint(byte),
    ).join("");
    return btoa(binString);
  }
  ```
  Cursed.
